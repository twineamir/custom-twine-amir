	<h4>
		{{ 'Synopsis Node'| say }}
	</h4>

	<p>
		This is an automatically generted node where you can specify the number  <br>
and names of the Avatars and write a description of the stage, scene and story. <br>
The default is 2 Avatars, AvatarA and AvatarB. <br>
To set the number and names of the Avatars change the list [AvatarA, AvatarB] <br>
e.g. [Host, Guest, Narrator]
	</p>

	<h4>
		{{ 'Avatar Node Usage'| say }}
	</h4>

	<p>
		This node includes all the directives for animating the scene. <br>
You can specify the model or animation by changing the {NAME} including the curly brackets. <br>
If {NAME} is left unchanged, this is interpreted as NONE. <br>
<br>
    SCREEN:<br>
        (set: $Screen to "Screen_{NAME}")<br>
    Screen_{NAME} specifies the graphics that appear on the screen.<br>
	<br>
    STAGE:<br>
	    Scene:<br>
		    $Model: the name of the model of the entire scene <br>

		    $Effect: the name of the effect to be applied to the sound<br>
		    $Duration: how long the sound is played in seconds<br>
			<br>
    OBJECTS({N}):<br>
        the default is 2 objects. i.e. OBJECTS(2)<br>
        this can be changed at any point, for example setting to OBJECTS(4) will generate 4 object blocks <br>
        in the nodes created subsequently (current node not included, must manually copy and paste).<br>
		<br>
        for each object, you can specify:<br>
            $Model: the name of the object model<br>
            e.g. (set: $Model to "ObjectModel_Ball") <br>
		    $Origin: the intial position of the object. <br>
            e.g. (set: $Origin to (0,0,0))  <br>
		    $Anim: the name of the animation<br>
            e.g. (set: $Anim to "ObjectAnim_Rolling")<br>
            $Origin: the final position of the object. <br>
            e.g  (set: $Destination to "(5,5,5)")<br>
            $Duration: the duration of the animation in seconds or number of loops<br>
            e.g (set: $Duration to 6)<br>
            $Lighting: the lighting specific to the object<br>
            $Sound: the sound specifc to the object<br>
            $Duration: how long the sound is played <br>
			<br>
    AVATARS:<br>
        The number of Avatars and their names are set in the synopsis<br>
        for each Avatar, you can specifiy:<br>
            in VOICE:<br>
                the dialogue to be spoken by the Avatar<br>
                e.g. replacing "{INSERT DIALOGUE HERE}" with "Hello world!"<br>
                if {INSERT DIALOGUE HERE} is left unchanged, this is interpreted as <br>
                the Avatar is not speaking<br>
            in Sound:<br>
                $Effect: the effect to be applied to the spoken dialogue<br>
                e.g. (set: $Effect to "SoundEffect_Echo")<br>

                $Directive: the directions for the open ended animation of the Avatar<br>
                e.g. (set: $Directive to "BeAngry") will start an open animation <br>
                of the Avatar. To bring back the Avatar to its initial position <br>
                specify the transition in the following Avatar node by setting $Directive to<br> 
                the name of the transition.<br>
                e.g. (set: $Directive to "Transition01") in the following node.<br>
			    $Duration: how long the open animation should run<br>
                e.g. (set: $Duration to 5)<br>
				<br>
	AvatarA:<br>
		Voice:<br>
			"{INSERT DIALOGUE HERE}"<br>
			(set: $Name to "VoiceName{NAME}")<br>
		Sound:<br>
			(set: $Effect to "SoundEffect{NAME}")<br>
		OpenAnim:<br>
			(set: $Directive to "{NAME}")<br>

			(set: $Duration to {N})<br>
			<br>
Specify the next node to go to by changing [[{NextNodeTitle}]]<br>
e.g. [[LogicNode5]]
	</p>



	<h4>
		{{ 'Logic Node Usage'| say }}
	</h4>

	<p>
		This node specifies the logic that determines how to travel down the dialogue tree <br>
and create diffrent story lines.<br>
Specify the number of possible next node options by setting {N}<br>
e.g. UserOptions:3<br>
    $IsRandom: must be set to either true or false, leaving it unchanged <br>
    is interpreted as false. <br>
    e.g. (set: $IsRandom to true)<br>
    if true, the next node to go to is picked at random<br>
    $IsConditional: must be set to either true or false, leaving it unchanged <br>
    is interpreted as false. <br>
    e.g. (set: $IsConditional to true)<br>
    if true, the next node to go to is determined based on the condition in each <br>
    UserResponse<br>
    $IsSpecific: must be left unchanged if not used, otherwise, you must specify<br>
    the probability of going to each possible next node to a number between 0.0 and 1.0<br>
    e.g. (set: $IsSpecific to {0.1,0.4,0.5}) <br>
    means go to UserResponse1 10% of the time, UserResponse2 40% and Userresponse3 50% of the time.<br>
    $IsOpen: must be set to either true or false, leaving it unchanged <br>
    is interpreted as false.<br>
    e.g. (set: $IsOpen to true)<br>
    if true, the dialogue goes to an open conversation using a third party chat bot<br>
    and comes back when finished to the dialogue tree, the specifics of when and where <br>
    to come back must be set in the OpenConv block.<br>
    $IsOpen will also be set true automatically if none of all the above are false<br>
    i.e. if $IsRandom, $IsSpecific, $IsConditional are all false, $IsOpen is set to true<br>
    and acts as a default<br>
	<br>
for each UserResponse, you can specify the following:<br>
    $MicSpeech: the set of predicted responses to check for when the user speaks<br>
    e.g.($MicSpeech is  "Yes")<br>
    to include multiple iterations, seperate by "//"<br>
    e.g.($MicSpeech is  "Yes//Of course//Yeah")<br>
    $CamF: possible data from the front camera<br>
    $AnalysisBasic_{NAME}: is either true of false<br>
    {NAME} must be changed to specify the basic analysis used. <br>
    e.g. ($AnalysisBasic_Adventurousness is  true)<br>
    $AnalysisCustom_{NAME}: is either true of false<br>
    {NAME} must be changed to specify the custom analysis used. <br>
	e.g. ($AnalysisCustom_Intelligence  false)<br>
    You can add any number of AnalysisBasic or AnalysisCustom lines to the <br>
    Userresponse block<br>
	<br>
in OpenConv, you can specify the duration of the open conversation, its <br>
starting node and ending node.<br>
e.g.    (set: $Duration to 5)<br>
        start: [[TransitionForward01]]<br>
        end:   [[TransitionBack02]]<br>
$Duration: can also be set to a string value as in the following cases:<br>
        (set: $Duration to "Random") #picks at random from [1,10]<br>
        (set: $Duration to "High")   #picks at random from [7,10]<br>
        (set: $Duration to "Low")    #picks at random from [1,3]<br>
		<br>
the last lines of the logic node specify the next nodes to go to<br>
corresponding to each user response. {NextNodeTitle} is all that has to be changed <br>
here<br>
e.g. (if: $UserResponse1 is true)[ [[UserNode1]] ] 
	</p>



	<h4>
		{{ 'Universal Node Usage'| say }}
	</h4>

	<p>
		This node specifies logic that is executed at any instance if true.<br>
The conditions can be added to or removed at any point by adding similar lines.<br>
if a line contains a {VALUE} field, then it may be specified.<br>
e.g.<br>
(if: $MicSpeech is {VALUE})<br>
[ [[{NextNodeTitle}]] ]<br>
can be changed to  <br>
(if: $MicSpeech is "Yelling")<br>
[ [[{NextNodeTitle}]] ]<br>
leaving "{VALUE}" unchanged means the codition is dismissed <br>
<br>
if a condition has no {VALUE} field, then it should not be modified<br>
e.g. <br>
(if: $ScreenZoom is true)<br>
[ [[{NextNodeTitle}]] ]<br>
means in the case of the user zooming, the dialogue goes to the specified node <br>
immediately<br>
	</p>


	<h4>
		{{ 'Logic Node Usage'| say }}
	</h4>

	<p>
		User node data is not read except for the next node directive. <br>
You can copy the UserResponse conrresoinding to the user node from its <br>
preceding logic node for the clarity of the dialogue tree.<br>
	</p>
